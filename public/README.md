[**HERE 4 REENTRY | A Toolkit For Coming Home**](https://www.here4reentry.com)

****

**We Are Here 4 Reentry** : We are a group of returning citizens and community activists who understand the challenges of coming back to Baltimore after incarceration. Our goal is to give you the keys for success in your journey. Our website is a place to get information and support from people who have been in your position. Come get connected to the resources you need!

 -*We are dedicated to creating service support for individuals with urban poverty struggles*

Even though we are online, we believe that talking to someone who has successfully reentered society is the best way to get real questions answered. You can:
  - Chat with one of our returning citizen leaders through the site.
  - Call through the *"Ringdown"* to speak with a returning citizen who is an expert in the type of resource you are looking for.
  - Participate in community discussions through *"Word of Mouth"*.
  - Visit the Womxnâ€™s Corner( the X in women represents all individuals who identify as a women) for advice and support around womxn-specific issues.
  - Join the fight to change policies that affect your life!

**About Ringdown** | [GitHub](https://github.com/Word-of-Mouth/ringdown)

Ringdown is a way for you to talk with a real person who has successfully reentered society. Your phone call will go to a list of trained volunteers with personal experience accessing services. We are friendly, professional, and here to help!

[**About Word of Mouth**](http://w-o-m.us) | [GitHub](https://github.com/discourse/discourse)

The most valuable information in the reentry community often comes from word of mouth. This app is a place for returning citizens, family, and friends to start discussions, ask and answer questions, and connect with one another. You can ask for advice anonymously or help someone by sharing your experience. Read through what others are saying or write your own post to add to the conversation!

  - People talking about what works
  - Insider information
  - People who know about job opportunities
  - What's going on in the community and whats most beneficial

[**Community Accountability**]() | [Assessment Tool](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eL6GWcyqDuLn6gOnKK9eHSSec4BdQ--DHxwoD07GSPs/pub)

Our team of returning citizens have been secret shopping different services across the city and we want to share our experiences? with you! We are here to hold services accountable for providing quality, trauma-informed care.

This is a good way to compare service options before you choose where to go. Check out our [Top Picks]() for services we love!

This is the Survey we utilized to evaluate services. You can be a part of our work by filling one out yourself to share your experience and add to our research.

*We evaluate services based on these principles of trauma informed care:*
  - Safety,
  - Trustworthiness and Transparency,
  - Collaboration and Peer Support,
  - Empowerment,
  - Choice and Intersectionality.
